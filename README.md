Qaizureen's personal website

In developing my personal portfolio website, I focused on creating a clean, soft and user-friendly design that reflects my identity as a content creator. I chose a minimal layout with pastel colour tones to create a calm and welcoming visual experience. 
The card-based structure helps organise information clearly and makes the content easier to read and navigate. I also prioritised visual storytelling by incorporating images, videos and a GIF to showcase my work and interests in a more engaging way.

One of the main challenges I faced was arranging the layout using CSS Grid while maintaining consistency across different screen sizes. Positioning elements such as full-width sections, centred media and hover effects required careful adjustment and testing. 
Another challenge was balancing aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that interactive elements like buttons, links and hover effects remained intuitive and accessible without overwhelming the design.

Throughout this project, I learned the importance of planning page structure before coding and how small CSS adjustments can significantly impact the overall layout. I also gained a better understanding of responsive design, media integration and user interaction through hover effects. 
This experience improved my confidence in using HTML and CSS to create a visually appealing and functional website, and it highlighted the value of iterative testing and refinement during the development process.
